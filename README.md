Assignment 2 - Data Visualization, 5 Ways

# d3
TODO: insert image

Using d3 was slightly more difficult for me than the rest of the visualizations simply because the documentation was new and somewhat confusing. After learning the ropes and getting the hang of things, I quickly found a way to complete the task. In the future I would consider using this tool for similar plots or visualizations where appearance matters. The plots are easy to stylize how I want. The trickiest part was probably figuring out how to get the major and minor axes correct, so to get that to work I had to implement a few functions in odd spots, where I'm pretty sure there would be a better way to do it in the future.


# Python

Python was relatively easy for me as I have been coding in Python for a few years now. I would consider using this tool if my visualization were very data intensive. Python is good at handling data and makes it easy to store data in an array of data structures. Handling large data sets is very easy with Python. The main challenge that I had to work with was using the plot object versus using the axis object. The difference between them was a little confusing but I believe I stumbled upon the correct usage for both.


# Excel

Excel was fairly quick for me, but was frustrating to find the correct graph settings. I used only the GUI provided, but if I had used google scripts it may have made the process a little easier. I would see this tool being useful if a graph needed to be whipped up quickly, but if stylistic preferences are very niche or specific, google sheets can most likely not achieve this.
